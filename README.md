**This repository contains my work on machine learning**

# Artificial Neural Network Experiments
Some experiments on different parameters and architectures of neural networks. A subset of Fashion-MNIST dataset is used in training. The effect of some parameters (learning rate, activation function and different ANN architectures ...) on the training process was examined.
# hw1: Image Reconstruction using Evolutionary Algorithms
Some experiments on different parameters of EA examined.
